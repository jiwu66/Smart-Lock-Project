## Introduction
As technology grows, people now don't need to remember to bring their keys with them every time.
Numerous new kinds of lock are being invented and produced to help people create a safer and more convinient life for their family and themselves.\
In this project, I am going to create one of those locks myself. The lock uses fingerprints to identify the users and unlock. The project contains a MCU, a finger print module,
a 4x4 keyboard, a OLED screen, and a step motor. Details of each motor can be found in the sections below.
